# Assignment: Coordinated Views
For the last assignment you can choose between the data from meteorite landings or the journalist kills. It is also ok to use the visualization from your previous assignment.
The goal of this assignment is to connect two visualizations with interaction. Two visualizations means, you will have two svg elements in your html with different dimensions of one dataset (f.e. map and bar chart, or have a look at the reference links). 

* First, think about the dimensions of the dataset. Which are interesting together? What kind of abstraction do you need for your dataset (f.e. count elements per year, country or type). 
* Decide what kind of primitives each visualization has and figure out, which dimension inside your dataset makes one record unique (-> modifications of assignment 2 and 3 in the materials section of income).
* The last step is the connection between both visualizations. What kind of interaction triggers a redrawing of the other chart (and vice versa)? What kind of data reduction / aggregation is needed before a redraw can be triggered?

## Criteria to pass the Assignment
* your Visualizations has to work without any errors in the developer console
* connect two visualizations
* choose the right primitives in both charts
* customize your visualization in terms of colors
* have some interactions (zoom, mouse over, click) and connect both of your visualization
* remove commented out code parts
* presentation in the course: explain your process, show your sketched ideas, any interesting insights inside the dataset?

## Dates

* Deadline to upload the assignment in income: 3rd July 2017
* Presentation: 5th July 2017
