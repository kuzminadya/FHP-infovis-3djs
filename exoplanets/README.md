# List of exoplanets in the conservative and optimistic habitable zone
"The Earth Similarity Index (ESI), or the "easy scale," is an open multiparameter measure of Earth-likeness for solar or extrasolar planets as a number between zero (no similarity) and one (identical to Earth). [...]
The ESI can be used to simplify planet comparisons, identify planets of interest from large databases, prioritize follow-up observations, and perform statistical analyses on the occurrence of Earth-like planets. [...]
The ESI is not a direct measure of habitability but formally a fuzzy comparison, using a distance metric, between a selected set of planetary properties of a planet and Earth. The more properties are used in the ESI calculation, the better the comparability with Earth (i.e. identify the 'Earth' cluster in a large database). [...]" [2]

Note: I used the lists from german wikipedia as a data resource

## Parameters

* Name
* ESI: earth similarity index
* planet type: defined by PHL based on: stellar classification[3] (A,G,M,K), position in the habitable zone[4] (warm, hot, cold), and size of the planet (Miniterran, Subterran, Terran, Superterran, Jovian, Neptunian)
* mass: minimal mass of the planet, unit: earth mass
* radius: radius of the planet, unit: earth radius
* flux: average energy flow of the planet, unit: radiant flux(Fe)[5]
* teq: planetary equilibrium temperature, unit: Kelvin(K)
* period: duration of one orbit around the planets host star, unit: days(d) (based on earth days)
* distance: from host star to earth, unit: light-years (ly)
* status: is the existance of the planet confirmed during observations
